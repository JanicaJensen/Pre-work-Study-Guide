      <ul>
        <li>Tags
          <ul>
            <li>!DOCTYPE HTML: Tells browser this is an HTML page.</li>
            <li><strong>html:</strong> This does not have a closing tag, goes before <i>head</i> and includes:</li>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>lang="en":</strong> This gets included in the html tag.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>head:</strong> Where you include:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>base:</strong> An open tag that displays the base url for the webpage.</li>
                <li><strong>link:</strong> An open tag that links to an external html document such as a stylesheet.
                </li>
                <li><strong>meta:</strong> Goes inside <i>head</i> tag, doesn't have a closing tag but includes a /
                  before >, and includes elements such as:
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>charset:</strong> Character set, the bootcamp course says that UTF-8 is what allows for
                      the most characters and symbols on the page. This sets <i>character encoding</i>, whatever that
                      is.</li>
                    <li><strong>viewport:</strong> This sets the default view for the webpage but, I'm not sure I know
                      what that means yet. From what I can tell in the code package for this study guide, it has to do
                      with dimensions.</li>
                    <li>keywords: I don't know what the tag for this is yet but it was mentioned in the video.</li>
                    <li>author: I also don't know what the format of the tag is for this, but it was mentioned that you
                      put author info in this section.</li>
                  </ul>
                <li><strong>style:</strong> This is where style tags go for any CSS that is being included on the page
                  itself rather than in a stylesheet.</li>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>body:</strong> This is where everything visible on the site goes. Includes headers, footers,
          paragaph elements, sections, divs, etc. Whatever will be SEEN.
        </li>
        </li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Semantic elements <ul>
          <li><strong>main:</strong> Designates the content as the main focus of the page.</li>
          <li><strong>section:</strong> Designates the content as a cohesive section of the page.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Questions I have:
        <ul>
          <li>Is there a set way we are supposed to lay out this code? Spacing, lines, etc?</li>

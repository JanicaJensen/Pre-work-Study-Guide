            <li><strong>html:</strong> This does not have a closing tag, goes before <i>head</i> and includes:</li>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>lang="en":</strong> This gets included in the html tag.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>head:</strong> Where you include:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>base:</strong> An open tag that displays the base url for the webpage.</li>
                <li><strong>link:</strong> An open tag that links to an external html document such as a stylesheet.
                </li>
                <li><strong>meta:</strong> Goes inside <i>head</i> tag, doesn't have a closing tag but includes a /

                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>charset:</strong> Character set, the bootcamp course says that UTF-8 is what allows for
                      the most characters and symbols on the page. This sets <i>character encoding</i>, whatever that
                      is.</li>
                    <li><strong>viewport:</strong> This sets the default view for the webpage but, I'm not sure I know
                      what that means yet. From what I can tell in the code package for this study guide, it has to do
                      with dimensions.</li>
                    <li>keywords: I don't know what the tag for this is yet but it was mentioned in the video.</li>

                      put author info in this section.</li>
                  </ul>
                <li><strong>style:</strong> This is where style tags go for any CSS that is being included on the page
                  itself rather than in a stylesheet.</li>

      <h3>How to create a style sheet</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Navigate to the directory prework-study-guide in terminal.</li>
        <li>cd assets --></li>
        <li>git status (need to be on main branch or switch to it) --></li>
        <li>git checkout main --></li>
        <li>git checkout -b feature/add-css --></li>
        <li>Voila! Now you should be able to see style.css nestled under prework-study-guide sidebar in VSCode</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <h3>CSS Rules</h3>
      <br>
      <p>CSS Rules consist of selectors and declarations. </p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><i>property</i> + <i>value</i> = <i>declaration</i>
          <ul>
            <li>declarations include punctuation of <i>property</i><strong>:</strong>
              <i>selector</i><strong>;</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><i>selector</i> + <i>declaration</i> = <i>rule</i></li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>How to use CSS</h3>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Inline... <ul>
            <li>to style an element directly.
            <li>which is harder to change because it requires individual handling.</li>
            <li>by using the <i>style = " "</i> attribute.</li>
            <li>which has the benefit of being good for quick and permanent changes.</li>
        </li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Internal CSS stylesheet
        <ul>
          <li>which is included in the html document itself using the <i>style</i> element tag within the <i>head</i>
            tags.</li>
          <li>which allows you to set rules but for that page only!</li>
          <li>which utilizes CSS classes and IDs to change multiple things on the page using rules.</li>
      </li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>External CSS stylesheet document
        <ul>
          <li>which is the most common and preferred way to style a webpage.</li>
          <li>which allows for enveloping changes and keeps design uniform throughout rather than page-by-page.</li>
          <li>which requires the use of a <i>link</i> element in the <i>head</i> tags to relay the css stylesheet
            properties.</li>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>How to link an external stylesheet</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Within the <i>head</i> element, add a <i>link</i> element with a <i>rel=</i> attribute that states that it is a
        stylesheet, and an <i>href=</i> attribute that links the document path.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Useful tips</h3>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>You can include multiple selectors for a rule by <i>selector 1,</i> -->new line<i>selector 2</i>
        <li> * is a wild card selector that applies to every element ever...?</li>
        <li>DRY code is <i>do not repeat yourself</i> code and this encourages the sharing of pieces of code that need
          to be written or maintained. Kind of like, reducing a fraction or using object pronouns.</li>
        <li>Think of html elements like boxes, from outside to inside it's <i>margin</i>,
          <i>border</i> (like the outline), <i>padding</i> (space between border and content), and <i>content.</i>
        </li>
      </ul>

            One such example is a <i>click event</i> which is something that happens when you click. That would look
            like this:<br><br>
            <span class="destacar">document . querySelector ("html"). addEventListener ("click", function () { <br>

            is selected and the event listener is the click. The code above is anonymous because it has no name.

            Above is a variable named <i>shapes</i> which is an array that holds a group of values, in this case, four
            different shapes.
            <br>
            The following code shows a student named Lu, his name, age and whether he's enrolled.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="destacar">

            </span>
            <br>
            <br>
            The student's name is surrounded by quotation marks because Lu is a string and they must be contained by
            quotation marks. 54 is a number and "true" is a boolean value so they do not require "". This array contains
            a string, a number, and a boolean value.
            <br>
            <br>
            If your code needs to reference a single item in an array, then you can reference it by its number based on
            its position in the array.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you have the shapes variable from above, then you deicde you want to call on <i>triangle</i>, then you
            would use: <span class="destacar">Shapes[0];</span> because it's the first shape in the array and JS starts
            at zero when numbering.
            <br>
            You'd end up with: <span class="destacar">console.log(shapes[0]);</span>

          <td>To use the For Loop we need index and array's length. Length is so that the Loop knows how many times it
            needs to run the code until there are no items left in the array.
            <br>
            This contains 3 important statements.
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Statement 1: Determines the starting point for the loop.
                <ul>
                  <li>To start at the beginning of an array, declare a variable and give it a value of 0.
                    <ul>
                      <li><i>var x = 0;</i></li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Statement 2: Condition, as long as the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will
                keep running. The loop will execute one time for each item in the array. The length built-in array
                property will express that condition like so:
                <ul>
                  <li><i>x < shapes</i>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Statement 3: Final statement. Allows the array to iterate over each item. Number increases by one each
                time. <i>X ++ </i> is the shortcut way of writing <i>x + 1</i>, now every time the code loops x will
                increase by 1 as so:
                <ul>
                  <li><i>X++</i></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            A for loop starts with <i>for</i>.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="destacar">
              for(var x=0; x < shapes.length; x++){ <br>
                //code block<br>
                }
            </span>
            <br>
            <br>
            We put code that we want to execute in curly brackets. We want each of the items to be logged (shapes array)
            in the console. Instead of the actual index number, you add X variable from our loop. Now it will go up by 1
            and the next item will log.

            "Does-not-equal" gives basically the same result with differemt syntax. Here we are testing "is myVariable

          <ul>
            <li>!DOCTYPE HTML: Tells browser this is an HTML page.</li>
            <li><strong>html:</strong> This does not have a closing tag, goes before <i>head</i> and includes:</li>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>lang="en":</strong> This gets included in the html tag.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>head:</strong> Where you include:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>base:</strong> An open tag that displays the base url for the webpage.</li>
                <li><strong>link:</strong> An open tag that links to an external html document such as a stylesheet.
                </li>
                <li><strong>meta:</strong> Goes inside <i>head</i> tag, doesn't have a closing tag but includes a /
                  before >, and includes elements such as:
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>charset:</strong> Character set, the bootcamp course says that UTF-8 is what allows for
                      the most characters and symbols on the page. This sets <i>character encoding</i>, whatever that
                      is.</li>
                    <li><strong>viewport:</strong> This sets the default view for the webpage but, I'm not sure I know
                      what that means yet. From what I can tell in the code package for this study guide, it has to do
                      with dimensions.</li>
                    <li>keywords: I don't know what the tag for this is yet but it was mentioned in the video.</li>
                    <li>author: I also don't know what the format of the tag is for this, but it was mentioned that you
                      put author info in this section.</li>
                  </ul>
                <li><strong>style:</strong> This is where style tags go for any CSS that is being included on the page
                  itself rather than in a stylesheet.</li>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>body:</strong> This is where everything visible on the site goes. Includes headers, footers,
          paragaph elements, sections, divs, etc. Whatever will be SEEN.

      <h3>How to create a style sheet</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Navigate to the directory prework-study-guide in terminal.</li>
        <li>cd assets --></li>
        <li>git status (need to be on main branch or switch to it) --></li>
        <li>git checkout main --></li>
        <li>git checkout -b feature/add-css --></li>
        <li>Voila! Now you should be able to see style.css nestled under prework-study-guide sidebar in VSCode</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <h3>CSS Rules</h3>
      <br>
      <p>CSS Rules consist of selectors and declarations. </p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><i>property</i> + <i>value</i> = <i>declaration</i>
          <ul>
            <li>declarations include punctuation of <i>property</i><strong>:</strong>
              <i>selector</i><strong>;</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><i>selector</i> + <i>declaration</i> = <i>rule</i></li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>How to use CSS</h3>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Inline... <ul>
            <li>to style an element directly.
            <li>which is harder to change because it requires individual handling.</li>
            <li>by using the <i>style = " "</i> attribute.</li>
            <li>which has the benefit of being good for quick and permanent changes.</li>
        </li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Internal CSS stylesheet
        <ul>
          <li>which is included in the html document itself using the <i>style</i> element tag within the <i>head</i>
            tags.</li>
          <li>which allows you to set rules but for that page only!</li>
          <li>which utilizes CSS classes and IDs to change multiple things on the page using rules.</li>
      </li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>External CSS stylesheet document
        <ul>
          <li>which is the most common and preferred way to style a webpage.</li>
          <li>which allows for enveloping changes and keeps design uniform throughout rather than page-by-page.</li>
          <li>which requires the use of a <i>link</i> element in the <i>head</i> tags to relay the css stylesheet
            properties.</li>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>How to link an external stylesheet</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Within the <i>head</i> element, add a <i>link</i> element with a <i>rel=</i> attribute that states that it is a
        stylesheet, and an <i>href=</i> attribute that links the document path.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Useful tips</h3>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>You can include multiple selectors for a rule by <i>selector 1,</i> -->new line<i>selector 2</i>
        <li> * is a wild card selector that applies to every element ever...?</li>
        <li>DRY code is <i>do not repeat yourself</i> code and this encourages the sharing of pieces of code that need
          to be written or maintained. Kind of like, reducing a fraction or using object pronouns.</li>
        <li>Think of html elements like boxes, from outside to inside it's <i>margin</i>,
          <i>border</i> (like the outline), <i>padding</i> (space between border and content), and <i>content.</i>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>The fun stuff - What can you change?</h3>

            0 = no extra space around the element.

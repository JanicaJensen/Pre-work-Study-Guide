# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description
This is "technically" a study guide with notes about what I've learned in University of Utah's Coding Bootcamp, which includes a little bit of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. I built this in order to put into practice the very simple chunks of coding language that I learned. It was an opportunity for me to build upon those skills as well, I did quite some "Googling" to figure out my initial issues with Github and some CSS formatting. I know it's not perfect and I could probably find a more efficient way to use page breaks (skipping lines) but I am a N00b so I am proud of what I've done here.

## Usage

The study guide is divided into 4 sections titled HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript. You can see notes under each section, these are not all-inclusive by any means but are just some of the most important/most-used concepts that I referenced to make the study guide in the first place. If you really want to, you can open up the console and see that there is a teeny little bit of Javascript that will pick a random topic for you to study, who knows, it could get it right on the first try! But if it doesn't, keep refreshing, eventually it'll say the name of the thing you need to practice most. Only you would know. Gasp!
